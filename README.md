Effect of Nucleation Heterogeneity on Mineral Precipitation in Confined Environment
============================
This repository is a collection of the solver and examples of simulations used in the paper submitted to the GRL.

Examples used in the paper
## Hagen-Poiseuille Flow
Nucleation on walls within reactive flow.

## Transport in Porous Media
Reactive flow and mineral precipitaion within a porous structure.
